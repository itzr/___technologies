- https://github.com/0xProject/0x-monorepo/blob/05b35c0fdcbca7980d4195e96ec791c1c2d13398/packages/contracts/src/2.0.0/protocol/Exchange/MixinSignatureValidator.sol#L85
---------------------------------------
Problem:
- EOA can sign messaged with PKs, but SCs cannot.
- Issue for Dapps with off-chain methods. SC cannnot interact with DApp.
- EIP-1271 = A way for any contract to verify whether a signature on behalf of a given contract is valid.
-------------------------------
Motivation: 
- More assets in SC > wallets expected.
- SC with user assets = smart account (ERC-725, -1078, -1077)
- a) contract acts an account (Smart account)
- b) contract does not act as an account, but requires signatures (!Smart Account)
- Example: off-chain order-books. SC cannot generate buy/sell orders since maker needs to own the asset, and sign the order.
------------------------------------------------------
Solution:

```
pragma solidity ^0.5.0;

contract ERC1271 {

  // bytes4(keccak256("isValidSignature(bytes32,bytes)")
  bytes4 constant internal MAGICVALUE = 0x1626ba7e;

  /**
   * @dev Should return whether the signature provided is valid for the provided data
   * @param _data Arbitrary length data signed on the behalf of address(this)
   * @param _signature Signature byte array associated with _data
   *
   * MUST return the bytes4 magic value 0x1626ba7e when function passes.
   * MUST NOT modify state (using STATICCALL for solc < 0.5, view modifier for solc > 0.5)
   * MUST allow external calls
   */ 
  function isValidSignature(
    bytes32 _hash, 
    bytes memory _signature)
    public
    view 
    returns (bytes4 magicValue);
}

```



--------------------------------------------------------
- DApps allow users to sign off-chain messages e.g. off-chain orderbooks (0x)
- Assume message will be / is signed by the same address that owns the asset
- However, assets can be held in: a) regular account via PK b) in a smart contract
- Current smart contract designs prevent contract based accounts from interacting with them. (SC do not contain PKs and cannot sign messages)
- EIP-1271 proposes a standardised way for contracts to verify if a provided signature is valid, when the account is a (another) contract.
