# Bind Mount (general)
- takes an existing directory tree and replicates it under a different point
- any modification on one side is immediately reflect on the other side.

On Linux: `mount --bind /some/where /else/where` 

# Bind Mount (docker)

- limited functionality vs. volumes
- when used: file or directory is mounted into a container
- rely on host machine's fs having a specific dir structure available.
- consider instead using **named volumes**
- you can't use Docker CLI commands to directly manage bind mounts.

# Volume

- new directory is created within Docker's storage directory 
- directory is stored on the host machine!
- Docker manages that directory's contents
- *preferred mechanism for persisting data generated by and used by Docker containers*
- Volume drivers allow you to:
    - store volumes on remote hosts or cloud providers
    - encrypt the contents of volumes
    
### Examples

Source: https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/installation/

## Bind Mount (example)

```bash
docker run \
    -p 9090:9090 \
    -v /tmp/prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml \
    prom/prometheus
```

- *.yml to *.yml
- The yml file is 'bind mounted'

## Volume (example)

```bash
docker run \
    -p 9090:9090 \
    -v /path/to/config:/etc/prometheus \
    prom/prometheus
```
