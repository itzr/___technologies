# The Basic Idea
- What are the user benefits /  Value to the end users?
- What are the core components?
- UI: Overview/Information on the core components?
    - Define sub-features and anything that may not be immediately obvious.
    - **Low-fidelity mock ups: Can just be shapes, so long as the idea is outlined**
- API: What are the endpoints, what do they look like?
- Extra top level requirements, e.g. Cache?
- Success metrics?
# Process
- Are we using JIRA?
- Who is code reviewing? Who is testing?
- What's the strategy for merging to master / tracking ids in branchs and commiting?
