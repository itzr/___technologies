    - see: prometheus *not logging but relevant*
        - share labelling system with loki 
    - see: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug-application-cluster/
- authentication for api calls
- understand difference between protocol types http vs tcp (done; see: https://www.extrahop.com/company/blog/2018/tcp-vs-http-differences-explained/) 

- (soon; likely for next phases) hosting kubernetes cluster on cloud 

# Logging and monitoring
