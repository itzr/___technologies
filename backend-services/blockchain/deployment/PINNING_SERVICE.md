### What is pinning: 
IPFS functions similar to a cache.

When it pieces a file together on a node, it's temporary.

If pieces becoming missing (node responsible for 1% of the file goes down perminently), the file will no longer be available. At least until/when/if it's recovered.

Pinning tells the node to keep the file intact.

This ensures important data is retained.
