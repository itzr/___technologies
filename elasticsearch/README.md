### Tools

- Elasticsearch DSL: 
	- Python (original)
	- PHP (https://github.com/ongr-io/ElasticsearchDSL/blob/master/docs/index.md)

ES DSL is a library to provide an objective query builder.

This is higher-level than the offical client, making it easier to write and run queries.

It mirrors the terminology and structure of the ES JSON DSL.

### Notes

- used docker
- used authXX clusters
- get cheatsheets
